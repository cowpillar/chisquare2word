# Chi-Square to Word
This program calculates the chi-square statistic by taking observed and expected values as input. It automatically computes the result and writes the chi-square equation in a Microsoft Word document.

Note: To avoid potential issues, it's best to open Microsoft Word first, then close it before running the program.
